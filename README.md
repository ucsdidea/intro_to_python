# UCSD IDEA: Intro to Python
Files for the Intro to Python workshops, presented by the IDEA Student Center of UC San Diego.

## Requirements
- python 2.x or 3.x
- jupyter notebook (formerly known as ipython-notebook)
- numpy
- matplotlib

## Installation
We *highly* recommend installing Python and related scientific packages using Anaconda, a free Python distribution available for with Windows, macOS and Linux. To install:

1. go to the Anaconda download page: [https://www.anaconda.com/download/](https://www.anaconda.com/download/)
2. download the Python **3.x** installer for your OS
3. run the installer

**NOTE**: The installer is large (approx. 600 MB), and can take a while to download and run. Which is why we ask workshop participants to perform the installation before arriving to the workshop.

## Starting Jupyter Notebook
The Python code in this repository uses Jupyter Notebook, a popular graphical interface for writing and running Python code which uses your web browser. To start Jupyter Notebook, you can either:
- a) use the Anaconda Navigator app: open the app and click "Launch Jupyter Notebook"
- b) open a terminal (Windows: Anaconda Prompt, macOS: Terminal.app), type "jupyter notebook" (without quotes) and hit enter to execute the command

For either option, you should see a terminal window open briefly and then your default web browser should open, with the URL set as ``localhost:8888``.

## Trying the code out (online)
If you're having trouble installing or running Python locally, you can try using the [Binder](http://mybinder.org/) online service to run the Python code: [![Binder](http://mybinder.org/badge.svg)](http://mybinder.org/repo/ucsdidea/intro_to_python)

**NOTE** The Binder service is free, but it is a temporary fix.
